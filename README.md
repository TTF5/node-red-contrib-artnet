# node-red-contrib-artnet2

# Aims of this fork
* Support artnet with memory so it is constantly sent out
* Fix fading so it doesn't cut to the previous value when fading between fades
* Have memory so on redeploy it will not return to 0
* Have memory so you can ask for channel values
* Will send the dmx output to the node output when the value is changing
* Delay for individual bucket elements (inspired by [node-red-contrib-artnetnode](https://github.com/klein0r/node-red-contrib-artnet-node))

## Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install. Usually this is `~/.node-red`
```
npm install node-red-contrib-artnet2
```

## Using

You can ask for channel values like so

```
msg.payload = {
};
```

It will return an array of values. If the value is null it has not been set and is not being output

```
msg.payload = {
  [255, 255]
};
```

You can either set a single channel like the following example:

```
msg.payload = {
  channel: 1, // int: address in [1, 512]
  value: 255  // int: value in [0, 255]
};
```

Or you can set multiple channels at once:

```
msg.payload = {
  buckets: [
    {channel: 1, value: 255},
    {channel: 4, value: 0},
  ]
};
```

You can also fade to values, either for a single channel or multiple channels. You should specify the 'transition' and also a 'duration' in milliseconds:

```
msg.payload={
    transition: "linear",
    duration: 5000,
    buckets: [
      {channel: 1, value: 255},
      {channel: 4, value: 0},
    ]
}
```

Add Delay to individual channels:

```
msg.payload={
    transition: "linear",
    duration: 500,
    buckets: [
      {channel: 1, value: 255, delay: 0},
      {channel: 1, value: 0, delay: 1000},
    ]
}
```

In order to perform arc transition (movement by arc) you shold specify more details:

```
msg.payload = {
    transition: "arc",
    duration: 2000,
    arc: {
        pan_channel: 1,
        tilt_channel: 3,
        pan_angle: 540,
        tilt_angle: 255
    },
    start: {pan: 0, tilt: 44},
    center: {pan: 127.5, tilt: 63.75},
    end: {pan: 85, tilt: 44}
};
```
where

- `arc` - channels that should be involved in arc transition (pan and tilt channels)
- `start` - initial channel's values (start point). By default: current channel's values.
- `center` - "center point" values
- `end` - terminal channel's values (end point)

In example above moving head will move by arc starting from {pan: 0, tilt: 44} to {pan: 85, tilt: 44}. Center point ({pan: 127.5, tilt: 63.75}) defines nominal circle center.
